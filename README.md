angular-stereo-viewer
=====================

Example of a stereo image viewer using AngularJS, Canvas, Drag-n-drop and HTML5 Download

## Setup
- Use bower to get AngularJS, or replace src with any CDN link using angular.
- Point browser at file. Thats it.

## Issues
- Should work in latest Chrome, currently not working in Firefox since it does not support drag-n-drop.
- Downloading large files makes the browser hang.

## Changes
- 30.4.2014 - Initial release, just enough to pass the homework this was intended for, I hope.

## Samples
 The samples were sourced from around the internet and may not be under the same license as the project.
